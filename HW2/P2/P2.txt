Most of these values between correlated and uncorrelated are pretty similar, with the exception of N=20 for the medium grain.  This makes sense, as in the correlated data almost all of the src/dest values are within a 10-point spread of each other.  Locking bins of N=20 will then almost always assign the same lock to both dest[idx] and src[idx].  That means we only have to acquire and release one lock instead of two in these cases - over many iterations we'll see a decent performance gain, due to the lower overhead of only having to lock once per round.  

We may be able to attribute the smaller (but still noticeable) speedup in the fine-grained scenario to the same basic idea - it's more likely that src[idx] and dest[idx] will be exactly the same in the correlated case, and so we probably hit more single-lock iterations than in the uncorrelated setup.
