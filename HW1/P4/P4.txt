Graph representation:

The graph representation I used was a list of tuples, each of the format:
( <character_name>, [<list_of_connected_characters>] ), where "connected characters" are characters that appeared in a comic along with <character_name>.  

I experimented with different partitioning schema, with 2,3,4,6,8,10, and 20 partitions. 
I was rather surprised to find that on my local machine (4 cores), a 3-partition setup was the fastest (best time: 17.78s).  The Spark documentation recommends assigning 2-4 partitions for each available core.  On my 4-core machine that should see optimal results at between 8-12 partitions...but many fewer turned out to be best.

Test case reports:

Root node: CAPTAIN AMERICA
Touched nodes*: 6403

Root node: MISS THING/MARY
Touched nodes*: 7

Root node: ORWELL
Touched nodes*: 9

*Touched node count includes root node


Re: distance = Undefined:

If nodes are undefined in SS-BFS, it means they are unconnected to other nodes in the subgraph formed by the search.
